Feature: Evaluations Endpoint
  As a data scientist
  I want to create evaluation jobs
  So that I evaluate models

  Scenario: Create an evaluation job
    Given the service is running
    When I send a POST request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs" with body "file:/evaluation_job.json"
    Then the response code should be 202
    And the response should contain the value "evaluation_job_created" at path "$.status.message.message_code"
    And the response should contain the value "pending" at path "$.status.state"
    And the response should contain the value "{{env:MODEL_NAME|test}}" at path "$.model.name"
    And the response should contain the value "{{env:MODEL_URL|http://test.com}}" at path "$.model.url"
    And the response should contain the value "arc_easy" at path "$.benchmarks[0].id"
    And the response should contain the value "garak|lm_evaluation_harness" at path "$.benchmarks[0].provider_id"
    And the response should contain the value "3" at path "$.benchmarks[0].parameters.num_fewshot"
    And the response should contain the value "5" at path "$.benchmarks[0].parameters.limit"
    And the response should contain the value "google/flan-t5-small" at path "$.benchmarks[0].parameters.tokenizer"
    And the response should contain the value "environment" at path "$.experiment.tags[0].key"
    And the response should contain the value "test" at path "$.experiment.tags[0].value"
    When I send a GET request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs/{id}"
    Then the response code should be 200
    And the response should contain the value "pending" at path "$.status.state"
    And the response should contain the value "{{env:MODEL_NAME|test}}" at path "$.model.name"
    And the response should contain the value "{{env:MODEL_URL|http://test.com}}" at path "$.model.url"
    And the response should contain the value "arc_easy" at path "$.benchmarks[0].id"
    And the response should contain the value "garak|lm_evaluation_harness" at path "$.benchmarks[0].provider_id"
    And the response should contain the value "3" at path "$.benchmarks[0].parameters.num_fewshot"

    And the response should contain the value "environment" at path "$.experiment.tags[0].key"
    And the response should contain the value "test" at path "$.experiment.tags[0].value"
    And the response should not contain the value "collection" at path "$."
    And I wait for the evaluation job status to be "completed"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs/{id}?hard_delete=true"
    Then the response code should be 204
    When I send a GET request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs/{id}"

    Then the response code should be 404
