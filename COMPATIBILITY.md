# EvalHub Compatibility

This document describes compatibility for this repository: the EvalHub server, its REST
API contract, published container images, and how clients (such as the Python SDK) relate
to a given server release.

> **Note:** All components are currently pre-1.0. Breaking changes may occur between
> minor releases. Prefer pinned image tags and release notes over `latest`.

## Sources of truth

| Concern | Where to look |
|---------|----------------|
| Server version / release notes | [GitHub releases](https://github.com/eval-hub/eval-hub/releases) and the `VERSION` file |
| REST API contract | OpenAPI under [`docs/openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi.yaml) (source: [`docs/src/`](docs/src/)); live docs at [eval-hub.github.io/eval-hub](https://eval-hub.github.io/eval-hub/) |
| Python SDK versions | [eval-hub-sdk](https://github.com/eval-hub/eval-hub-sdk) releases / PyPI |
| Image tags published by CI | [quay.io/evalhub/evalhub](https://quay.io/repository/evalhub/evalhub?tab=tags) (see [Container Image Tag Policy](#container-image-tag-policy)) |

## Versioning policy

- **EvalHub** (server) follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/). While the major version is
  `0`, minor bumps may include breaking API changes; treat them as potentially incompatible
  unless release notes say otherwise. After `1.0.0`, major bumps indicate breaking API changes.
- **SDK** uses [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning (including
  pre-releases such as `0.1.0a8`). Alpha / pre-release SDK versions may break between
  builds; prefer a stable SDK release when talking to a pinned server.

### Client guidance (pre-1.0)

- Align the SDK with a given server only when that SDK release explicitly documents
  support for it (see [eval-hub-sdk](https://github.com/eval-hub/eval-hub-sdk) releases).
  Matching version numbers alone is not a guarantee.
- Older clients may continue to work against newer servers when only additive API changes
  landed, but that is not a guarantee before `1.0.0`.
- When in doubt, compare the server OpenAPI for your deployed version with the SDK’s
  expected API surface, or upgrade the client with the server.

## API compatibility

The compatibility boundary for HTTP clients is the versioned REST API under `/api/v1`.
Behavioural contracts live in the OpenAPI specification for that release.

### What counts as a breaking change

- Removing or renaming an API endpoint
- Removing or renaming a request/response field
- Changing the type or semantics of an existing field
- Changing authentication or authorisation requirements
- Removing support for a previously accepted query parameter

### What does not count as a breaking change

- Adding new endpoints
- Adding new optional fields to requests
- Adding new query parameters with defaults that preserve existing behaviour
- Bug fixes that align behaviour with documented API contracts

Adding new fields to responses is generally compatible for clients that ignore unknown
properties. It may break strict clients that reject unknown fields or enforce a closed
schema; treat that as a client-side constraint rather than a server API break unless
release notes say otherwise.

Release notes (or the PR description for a version bump) should call out intentional
breaking changes when they occur.

## Container Image Tag Policy

The EvalHub container image is published to `quay.io/evalhub/evalhub`. CI produces the
following tags on pushes to observed branches (`main`, `develop`) and on version tags
(`v*`):

| Tag | When applied | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `latest` | Every push to an observed branch or a version tag | Always points to the most recent image pushed |
| `<branch>` | Branch push | `main`, `develop` |
| `<branch>-<sha>` | Branch push | `main-a1b2c3d…` |
| `<version>` | Tag push (`v1.2.3`) | `1.2.3` |
| `<major>.<minor>` | Tag push (`v1.2.3`) | `1.2` |

Non-release branch images may carry a Quay expiry annotation. Only full
`major.minor.patch` tags from `v*` releases (for example `1.2.3`) are durable pins.
`<major>.<minor>` tags (for example `1.2`) are mutable and move when later patch
releases of that minor line are published.

### Production deployments

Production environments should pin a specific full `major.minor.patch` tag (for example
`0.4.4`) rather than `latest` or a mutable `<major>.<minor>` tag. The `latest` tag is
useful for development and testing but may point to an unreleased commit on `main` or
`develop`.

## Keeping this document useful

Update this file when:

- The API compatibility rules change
- Image tagging behaviour in CI changes
- The preferred discovery links (releases, Quay, SDK) change

Do **not** add a multi-column version matrix here. Record server releases in GitHub
Releases; keep client version history in the SDK repository.

## Remark: ODH and RHOAI

Which EvalHub image ships in a given Open Data Hub or Red Hat OpenShift AI release is
decided outside this repository (typically via `evalHubImage` in TrustyAI Service Operator
overlays such as `params.env`). Consult
[trustyai-service-operator](https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-service-operator)
for product pins; this document does not track those combinations.
